# Description
This is a website for Horiseon
# What was the motivation?
The motivation behind this project was to learn why alt tag were important for people who use screen readers
# Why did I complete it?
I completed this project because I wanted to get more practice using alt and semantic tags
# What problem did I solve?
I solve some problems relating to missing alt tags from images. The website should work better for screen readers now that alt tags have been added. The website was also missing a title and it had a broken link in the header.
# What did I learn?
I learned the importance of creating web pages with alt tags and their effect on screenreaders. I also learned how to link `<a>` tags to elements and not only to other links. I learned how to add a title to a page.
